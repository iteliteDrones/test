        description: `In an ever-evolving technological landscape, the rise of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has brought both innovation and challenges.
        As the use of drones continues to grow, so does the need for effective countermeasures to safeguard sensitive areas and ensure public safety.​
        At ITELITE, we understand the critical importance of neutralizing potential threats posed by unauthorized drones.
        Our cost-effective and powerful ANTENNAS for anti-drone system utilizes sophisticated jamming technology, disrupting the electromagnetic signals used by these devices for data transmission and navigation.
        Covering a wide spectrum from 433MHz up to 7.2GHz frequency bands, our solution ensures comprehensive protection against a range of UAVs.`,

        specification: `Using these 2 antennas, you can build a system covering different sectors for bands 433MHz to 1.3GHz (PAT0413G5) and from 2.4GHz to 5.9GHz (PAT2450G10).
        Each antenna is vertically polarized.
        The PAT0413G5 gain is in the range of 3.4 – 8.7dBi. On the other hand, the PAT2450G10 gain is 9-10 dBi.`,
